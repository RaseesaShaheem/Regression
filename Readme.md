## REGRESSION TECHNIQUES

A Python-based regression analysis project on the California Housing dataset (from sklearn.datasets).The goal is to predict median house prices (MedHouseVal) based on features such as average income, house age, number of rooms, population, and other housing attributes. The analysis aims to apply different regression techniques, evaluate model performance, and identify the best model for predicting house prices.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

* Dataset size: 20,640 rows × 8 features (plus target).

* Focus: Comprehensive regression analysis of California housing data.

* Primary Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

## OBJECTIVES

* Explore and preprocess the California Housing dataset.

* Apply different regression techniques:

- Linear Regression

- Decision Tree Regressor

- Random Forest Regressor

- Gradient Boosting Regressor

- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

* Evaluate model performance using metrics: MAE, MSE, R²

* Visualize predictions vs actual values for insights.

* Identify the best-performing model for predicting median house prices.

## QUICK START

* Import required libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

* Load the California Housing dataset using sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing

* Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, scaling if needed)

* Split the dataset into training and testing sets (optional,as it is already splitted in the beginning itself)

* Apply regression models and evaluate performance

* Provide insights

## DATA PREPROCESSING

* Handle missing values,dulications, outliers.

* Perform feature scaling.

* Split dataset into X (features) and y (target).

* Split into train/test sets using train_test_split.
